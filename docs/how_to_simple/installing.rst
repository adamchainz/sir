Configuring the BGP controller
==============================

We are going to run the BGP controller inside the **Internet Router**. You can run it outside if you prefer or if you canÂ´t install software on your switch.

As we already explained, the BGP Controller consists of two different software pieces:

 * pmacct_ - Which will get the BGP feed and flow statistics from the Internet Router and aggregate statistics per BGP prefix.
 * sir - Which will get the data generated by pmacct and compute the TopN prefixes and do various things with it.

We are going to use the following folders in our system:

 * **/pmacct** - Here is where we are going to install pmacct
 * **/sir** - Here is where we are going install sir
 * **/bgp_controller** - Here is where we are going to store the backend files and the data generated by sir
