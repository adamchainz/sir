Variables
#########

When reading this documentation you will find variables in two forms:

* **<variable>**: Variables that are between ``<>`` have to be replaced by their values in the URL. For example, ``/api/v1.0/variables/categories/<category>`` will turn into ``/api/v1.0/variables/categories/my_category``.
* **variable**: Variables that are NOT enclosed by ``<>``:
 * If the method is a GET variables that are between <> have to be replaced by their values in the URL. For example, ``/api/v1.0/variables/categories/<category>`` will turn into ``/api/v1.0/variables/categories/my_category``.
 * If the method is a POST or a PUT variables variables that are between <> have to sent as a JSON object.
