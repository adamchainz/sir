What is it?
===========

The SDN Internet Router, abbreviated SIR, is an agent that you can add to your router. The agent exposes information
that your router can't expose by itself; providing both a WebUI and an API to access this data.

The agent is vendor agnostic as it gathers data using both BGP and netflow/sflow/ipfix. This means it can be attached
to any router or switch that supports those protocols.
