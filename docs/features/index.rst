The agent enhances your router adding some nice features that are exposed both via the WebUI and the API. You can see
some examples of the features in the following pages. Although the examples are shown using the WebUI all the features
are also available via the API. Actually, features are built first for the API so there is the possibility that
you can do something with the API but not with the WebUI.
