Search Prefixes
---------------

You can search for any prefix of any prefix-length and get back all the possible routes that you could choose to reach
it. You will not get only the longest prefix match but all the possible matches.

.. note:: ``peer_ip_src`` is useful if you are sending data to the agent from different routers as it shows the IP of
          the router that provided those prefixes
